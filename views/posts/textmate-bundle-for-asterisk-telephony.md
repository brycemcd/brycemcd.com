As I’ve been getting more and more familiar with Asterisk I’ve been blindly editing the configuration files in TextMate with no context highlighting. This produced lots of really unnecessary errors. So, [I decided to build a bundle from scratch](http://www.github.com/brycem/asterisk-textmate-bundle).
 
It’s definitely a work in progress and I’d appreciate any work anyone else would like to put into it
